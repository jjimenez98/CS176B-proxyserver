We completed our project using python.

The first file you should run in server.py

The next file to run is proxy.py

The last file to run is client.py

You can run multiple instances of client.py because we added multithreading to the proxy server. 

The other file included is text.txt, it is not a significant file, it is just what we used for reference when 
getting our text for the messages. It is just so that it is easeir to grasp our explanation of how we set up the first 
we performed with RTT.
